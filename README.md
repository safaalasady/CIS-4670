# CIS-4670 - LAB 1

For this lab, my team (SWIT) conducted a file audit on a Windows Server 2019 system to identify and assess security vulnerabilities related to file permissions, data storage, and access control. We discovered several critical security flaws, including:
- Unencrypted plaintext credentials stored in accessible directories.
- Overly permissive file permissions granting “Everyone” full access rights.
- Sensitive internal system information stored in unprotected files.

To mitigate these risks, we recommended immediate removal of malicious or suspicious files, credential rotation, implementation of least-privilege access controls, encryption of sensitive data, and continuous system monitoring and logging.

This assessment demonstrated practical skills in vulnerability analysis, Windows Server auditing, and secure file management practices aligned with professional cybersecurity standards.
